        Attention was focused again on the effectiveness of laughter. The effectiveness of laughter is well known, but it has recently attracted attention again. Knowing and laughing will maximize the effectiveness of laughter.

In addition, endorphins are generated to give our bodies vitality and energy. Another surprising effect of laughter is the heart protection effect. Laughter helps smooth blood circulation to prevent heart attacks.
        Studies have shown that laughter is highly contagious. It would be a good idea to laugh as part of promoting national health. Psychologist William James also said, "I'm not laughing because I'm happy, but because I'm happy because I'm laughing."</p>
