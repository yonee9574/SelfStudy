        <h2>이용 안내</h2>
        <p>I don't drink coffee, I take tea, my dear
            I like my toast done on one side
            And you can hear it in my accent when I talk
            I'm an Englishman in New York
            See me walking down Fifth Avenue
            A walking cane here at my side
            I take it everywhere I walk
            I'm an Englishman in New York</p>
        <p>Oh, I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
            I'm an Englishman in New York
            Oh, I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
            I'm an Englishman in New York
            If "manners maketh man" as someone said
            He's the hero of the day
            It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile
            Be yourself no matter what they say</p>

            Modesty, propriety can lead to notoriety
            You could end up as the only one
            Gentleness, sobriety are rare in this society
            At night a candle's brighter than the sun</p>

        <p>Takes more than combat gear to make a man
            Takes more than a license for a gun
            Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can
            A gentleman will walk but never run
            If "manners maketh man" as someone said
            He's the hero of the day
            It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile
            Be yourself no matter what they say
            Be yourself no matter what they say
            Be yourself no matter what they say</p>
